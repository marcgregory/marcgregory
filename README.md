Iâ€™m a passionate web developer who loves creating modern, responsive, and interactive web applications. I specialize in React and work extensively with technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Framer Motion, and various CSS libraries.

I have hands-on experience integrating AWS services such as Simple Email Service (SES) for transactional email delivery, Movider SMS API for messaging services, Bux API for financial transaction processing, and PostgreSQL for managing relational databases.

I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m always eager to expand my knowledge and collaborate on projects involving modern web technologies.

I'm currently open to job opportunities and collaborations related to front-end and full-stack web development. Feel free to reach out â€” Iâ€™d love to connect!
